# Matlab_Time_and_freq_analysis_of_AM_and_FM_signals

I created this project in Matlab R2019 version, back in college, for a discipline called "Advanced Techniques for Electromagnetic Field Measurement". The requirements for the project were:

- graphical user interface;
- the possibility to modify and set the signals parameters - amplitude and frequency;
- different types of modulator signal: sine, square, sawtooth, sum of sine waves;
- the option to see the plotted signals: modulator, carrier, Amplitude Modulated with and without noise, its spectrum, the demodulated signal, Frequency Modulated signal with and without noise, its spectrum and the demodulated signal.

The file "Documentatie_Tehnici avansate de masurare a campului electromagnetic_Final.pdf" contains the detailed documentation of the project, in Romanian. 

The user interface parameters are in Romanian, but you can contact me if you need any help with the translation and application use.
